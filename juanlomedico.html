          <div class="title"><h2>Biography</h2></div> <div class="bio">
         <p> Originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Had my first computer when I was 7 years ols in 1989 a PC XT with DOS, since then I always had a passion to learn about them. I started learning Windows with the 3.0 version and I continued studying until the year 2000 when I moved to Miami. Once in Miami I worked primarely in the hospitality industry mainly because of the need of a job and being illegal until 2007. In 2009 I became General Manager in one of the first establishments in Wynwood "Joey's Italian Cafe", from there I managed other restaurants but I was unhappy in that field. I always dreamed working as a developer but having obligations with my family I had to stay in a steady well payed job. After a car accident in 2006 I was told I couldn't continue the pace that hospitality. This is what actually open the doors for me to finally learn and be involved in the development field and finally be happy in a carrer of my choice.</p>
